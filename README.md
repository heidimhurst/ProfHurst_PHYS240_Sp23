# Overview

This repository is for Professor Hurst's PHYS 240 class Spring 2023. Follow the instructions here to get started with the class repository.

## Forking the Repo

1. In the upper-right hand corner, find the ‘Fork’ button. Click Fork > Create a new fork. You should fork the main branch of the repo. 
2. Navigate back to your home profile and verify that you see the new repository ProfHurst_PHYS240_Sp23 in your list of repositories.

## Submitting Assignments

**IMPORTANT: In order to avoid overwriting your classmates assignments when merging pull requests, it is crucial that each file has a unique filename. In this class, please use EXACTLY the following naming convention on files you submit to the class repo: 
‘LastName_FirstName_AssignmentName.py’**

1. Open your copy of the class repo on GitHub.com. Using the headers on the top left, navigate to the ‘Pull Requests’ page. Click the green button to open a new pull request. 
2. Click the ‘compare across forks’ link to compare your repo to the forked repo. Now you will set up a PR to the student-submissions branch. Choose the drop down options that correspond to a submission from your repo (head repository) to base: student_submissions on my repo (hhurst/ProfHurst_PHYS240_Sp23). If you have multiple branches in your repository, choose the one with your final submission on it. 
3. Click ‘Create Pull Request’. A screen will come up with an option to write a note and preview the PR. Leave a brief comment like ‘Homework 1 submission’. Click ‘Create Pull Request’ again. 
4. Your PR is now complete! You can continue to write comments or add commits to it until it is closed. I will close all open class PRs for a particular assignment the day after the homework assignment is due. Your assignment is considered late if the PR was not initiated prior to the assignment deadline. 

## Updating a Fork

1. Navigate to the main branch of your copy of the class repository. If you are behind the upstream main branch (mine), you will see a note that says ‘This branch is XXX commits behind hhurst:main’. 
2. Click ‘Sync Fork > Update Branch’ to update your branch to include commits from the upstream repository. 

3. That’s it!
